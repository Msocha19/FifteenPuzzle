# FifteenPuzzle
A program that solves fifteen puzzle using bfs, dfs and astar heuristics. Prepared for Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems classes on TUL.

## Description
This project was created in order to compare performance of diferend heuristics while solving Fifteen Puzzle. For the astr heuristic i have examined perfomance using manhattan and hamming distance.

## Instruction
Program arguments
1. Strategy - can be "bfs", "dfs" or "astr"
2. Order - in which order should strategy look for an anwer(only for bfs and dfs)
3. Puzzle to solve - must be in the same format as provided in puzzle_examples, first 2 digits represent the size of the puzzle and the rest is the board to solve.
4. File name - where solution will be saved
5. File name - for additional statistics
